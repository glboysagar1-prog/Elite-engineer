# Wecraft Product Vision

## 1. One-Sentence Vision

Wecraft is an elite engineering talent discovery platform that identifies and ranks top engineers exclusively through their public GitHub proof-of-work, eliminating resumes and self-reported skills to create a trust-first, explainable, and scalable system for connecting exceptional technical talent with opportunities.

## 2. Recruiter Problem Statement

Recruiters and hiring managers face a fundamental trust deficit in technical hiring: they cannot reliably distinguish between engineers who can actually build production-quality systems and those who merely claim to possess skills. Traditional hiring relies on resumes filled with self-reported expertise, keyword-stuffed profiles, and credentials that may not reflect real-world coding ability. This leads to:

- **Time waste**: Interviewing candidates whose skills don't match their claims
- **False positives**: Hiring engineers who look good on paper but struggle with actual code
- **Missed opportunities**: Overlooking exceptional engineers who don't optimize their resumes or lack traditional credentials
- **Scalability challenges**: Manually reviewing portfolios and GitHub profiles is time-intensive and doesn't scale
- **Bias risks**: Resume-based screening perpetuates systemic biases and overlooks non-traditional backgrounds

Recruiters need an objective, automated system that surfaces elite engineers based on verifiable proof of their technical capabilities, not their ability to write compelling resumes.

## 3. Engineer Problem Statement

Elite engineers are often invisible to opportunities because their actual work—the code they write, the systems they build, the problems they solve—is buried beneath resume filters, keyword matching algorithms, and credential-based gatekeeping. They face:

- **Discovery barriers**: Exceptional code contributions don't translate to resume visibility
- **Credential bias**: Lack of traditional degrees or company names limits opportunities despite proven ability
- **Self-promotion burden**: Forced to spend time crafting resumes instead of building
- **Misrepresentation pressure**: Competing with inflated resumes creates perverse incentives
- **Opaque evaluation**: No transparency into how their work is being assessed or why they're overlooked

Engineers need a platform where their GitHub proof-of-work speaks for itself, where discovery happens through demonstrated capability rather than self-reported claims, and where their technical contributions are the primary currency of opportunity.

## 4. What Wecraft Explicitly Does NOT Do

Wecraft deliberately excludes traditional hiring mechanisms to maintain trust and objectivity:

- **Does NOT use resumes**: No PDF uploads, no text parsing, no resume-based profiles
- **Does NOT accept self-reported skills**: No "I know Python" checkboxes, no skill tags, no endorsements
- **Does NOT rely on credentials**: No degree requirements, no company name weighting, no certification validation
- **Does NOT use traditional screening**: No phone screens, no resume reviews, no keyword matching
- **Does NOT aggregate third-party data**: No LinkedIn imports, no job board scraping, no social media signals
- **Does NOT require opt-in profiles**: Engineers are discovered through public work, not self-registration
- **Does NOT rank by popularity metrics**: No follower counts, no star counts as primary signals, no social proof gaming
- **Does NOT make black-box decisions**: All rankings and assessments are explainable and transparent
- **Does NOT replace human judgment**: Wecraft surfaces candidates; humans make final hiring decisions
- **Does NOT guarantee placement**: Wecraft is a discovery platform, not a placement agency

Wecraft's strength comes from its constraints: by using only public GitHub proof-of-work, it creates a level playing field where code quality, architecture decisions, and technical contributions are the sole determinants of elite status.
